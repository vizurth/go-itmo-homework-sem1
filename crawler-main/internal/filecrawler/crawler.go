// Combiner is a function type that defines how to combine two values of type R into a single

//   - Modify one of its input arguments to include the result of the other and return it,
//     or
//   - Create a new combined result based on the inputs and return it.

// It is assumed that type R has a neutral element (forming a monoid)

// Crawler represents a concurrent crawler implementing a map-reduce model with multiple workers
// to manage file processing, transformation, and accumulation tasks. The crawler is designed to
// handle large sets of files efficiently, assuming that all files can fit into memory
// simultaneously.
type Crawler[T, R any] interface {
	// Collect performs the full crawling operation, coordinating with the file system
	// and worker pool to process files and accumulate results. The result type R is assumed
	// to be a monoid, meaning there exists a neutral element for combination, and that
	// R supports an associative combiner operation.
	// The result of this collection process, after all reductions, is returned as type R.
	//
	// Important requirements:
	// 1. Number of workers in the Configuration is mandatory for managing workload efficiently.
	// 2. FileSystem and Accumulator must be thread-safe.
	// 3. Combiner does not need to be thread-safe.
	// 4. If an accumulator or combiner function modifies one of its arguments,
	//    it should return that modified value rather than creating a new one,
	//    or alternatively, it can create and return a new combined result.
	// 5. Context cancellation is respected across workers.
	// 6. Type T is derived by json-deserializing the file contents, and any issues in deserialization
	//    must be handled within the worker.
	// 7. The combiner function will wait for all workers to complete, ensuring no goroutine leaks
	//    occur during the process.
