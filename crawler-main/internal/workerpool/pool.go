// The function is invoked concurrently by multiple workers, and therefore must be thread-safe

// Each worker independently applies the transformer to its own subset of data, and although
// no shared state is expected, the transformer must handle any internal state in a thread-safe
// manner if present.

// Searcher is a function type for exploring data in a hierarchical manner.
// Each call to Searcher takes a parent element of type T and returns a slice of T representing
// its child elements. Since multiple goroutines may call Searcher concurrently, it must be
// thread-safe to ensure consistent results during recursive  exploration.
//
// Important considerations:
//  1. Searcher should be designed to avoid race conditions, particularly if it captures external
//     variables in closures.
//  2. The calling function must handle any state or values in closures, ensuring that
//     captured variables remain consistent throughout recursive or hierarchical search paths.
